# Deno Lint Plugin and Rule

Unfortunately I missed the challenge this month **(March)**. So I decided to try to create my own lint rule/plugin anyway, without receiving stickers 😭

## Goal 🏁

Learn how to create a plugin following this [tutorial](https://deno.com/blog/lint-rules-contest).

## Result 📋

A rule that checks if a declared function's name starts with an upper case letter i.e. more or less conforms to pascalCase. 

## Tests 🧪

I never checked out Deno's test runner and hence decided to test my rule.
